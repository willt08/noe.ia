# Noe.ia: Recursive Self-Referential AI Framework

## Overview
Noe.ia is a formal research framework for self-referential semiosis in machine learning. It introduces recursive interpretative evolution, allowing AI systems to refine their cognitive structures iteratively. Unlike traditional models that rely on static representation learning, Noe.ia integrates a **triadic semiotic model** to enable self-referential stability.
